# Dislo-glide
In this repository, you'll find LAMMPS scripts and simulation boxes with dislocations in iron. These files can be freely modified to adapt them to the specific needs of your research. As this is quite old stuff that has been stored for some years without being touched, it's important to verify its suitability.
